# youtube-wrapper
## Overview
A python library that wraps around the YouTube V3 API. You can use it find and manage YouTube resources including Videos, Playlists, Channels and Comments.

The library is modelled after [Google's own documentation](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs/videos).

## Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- Works on Linux, Windows, macOS, BSD

## Installation

```sh
pip install youtube@git+https://github.com/twyle/youtube-wrapper
```

## Get started
To get started, you need a verified Google Account and Google API keys with the correct permissions.

### How to Get A Google API Key
Follow the instructions in this short [article](https://blog.hubspot.com/website/how-to-get-youtube-api-key) to get an API key.


To get a particular video using the videos' id:
1. Create an instance of the YouTube API passing in the path to the downloaded client secret file:
```sh
from youtube import YouTube

client_secrets_file = '/home/lyle/Downloads/secrets.json'
youtube = YouTube(client_secrets_file)
youtube.authenticate()
```
2. Use the video id to find the video:
```python
video = youtube.find_video_by_id('rfscVS0vtbw')
```
3. To find many videos using their id's:
```python
ids = ['rfscVS0vtbw', 'TFa38ONq5PY']
videos = youtube.find_videos(ids)
```
4. To find the most popular videos in a given region e.g Kenya, pass in the region code:
```python
popular_kenyan_videos = youtube.find_most_popular_video_by_region('ke')
```
5. To search for videos (this returns an iterator):
```python
query = 'Python programming'
video_iterator = youtube.search_video('Python')
videos = next(video_iterator)
```
